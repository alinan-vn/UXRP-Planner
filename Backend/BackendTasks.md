# NOTES/Problems
- Figure out schema for followers & following
- Figure out schema for wordpress type blog creator (drag and restructure)
    - Looking at the editing tool wireframe... On the left it seems that the user can select if they are editing the Problem/Research/Solutions/Outcome/Takeaway part of the case study. Is this edited individually by section, or is an overall edit. (i.e., maybe the contributor doesn't want a problem section, or wants to rename 'problem' section to 'issue' section)
- Figure out how to uploade/fetch/save images to rails

- contributor_about_details

# Tables

## contributor_about_details
### Notes/Problems
- "Do you work for a company? Which one? (if you don't know, that's ok)?"
    - It's set as a single input. Much easier to develop if there's a checkbox for yes/no. (If yes, input appears/can be typed in. If no, input doesn't appear/cannot be typed into)
- "Skills"
    - Figure out how to add a skill if they select 'other'. Is a new skill created into the backend or just for this one contributor?
- "Industries"
    - Figure out how to add a industry if they select 'other'. Is a new skill created into the backend or just for this one contributor?
